JasonPlaceholder API doesn't require any type of authorization.
All API calls can be performed by not authorized user.

In other situations when API calls can be performed only by authorized user,we need:
1. Read API documentation about autorization method
2. If it is an API key or API token, get it by  creating new user with POST and param username and password (mostlikely, but not limited to)
3. Further reuse your received token or API key in performing every call by setting Authozization method for whole collection.
