Test Cases


In Jasonplaceholder no authorization required, so we star steight from chcking end points.


Otherwise you would get authorized first and use token or api key for all authorized user API tests.


In our case, we perform few simple API calls with methods 

POST (creating data), 

GET (extracting data), 

PUT (updating data by fully erasing and placing new record instead), 

PATCH (updating partially our data), 

DELETE (deleting data).


In Jasonplaceholder we can check on this endpoints:


/posts (output 100 posts)

/comments (output 500 comments)

/albums (output 100 albums)

/photos (output 5000 photos)

/todos (output 200 todos)

/users (output 10 users)


We can check on nested resources as well. For example, photos in albums, albums for users, comments for posts.


After creating new data we validate the created data by extracting it. Same way after updating and deleting. 
Pay attention every time on responce code (it has to be related to our request logic) and responce time. Verify rquired headers or parameters if its neede in your test case.
